# 产品去背景
To remove the background from a product image using Python and deep learning, you can use a combination of image segmentation and image processing technology. A popular approach is to use a pre-trained model fro image segmentation, such as U-Net or DeepLabV3. These models can be fine-tuned for your specific use case if needed.

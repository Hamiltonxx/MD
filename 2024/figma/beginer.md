# Canvas
The canvas is the backdrop for all of your designs - it's where you'll add all the frames, shapes, text and images.

# Frames
With the great expanse that is the canvas, you need something to put your designs in.  
Frames are the containers you place your shape, text, and image layers in. You can think of each frame in the canvas as a single screen of your design.

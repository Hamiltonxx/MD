We have already released a technical component library, but we decided to go an extra-mile and decided to open source not only our code, but also the design.  
The file is divided into 3 different pages: the design tokens, the components, and the premade pages that you can use as much as you want.  

You can create the interface of your plugin or customize the UI of the strapi admin panel in a blink of an eye, using ready-made components and design guidelines.

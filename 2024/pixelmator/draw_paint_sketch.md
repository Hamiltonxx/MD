# Layers
Pixelmator Pro is a layer-based image editor. This means that instead of simply editing one image at a time, you can add and combine multiple elements of different kinds -- images,shapes,videos,masks,text,color adjustments -- to create your compositions and designs.  
You can think of layers as stacked transparent plastic sheets. If you add a completely empty layer and draw on it, the parts you draw over will no longer be transparent, but the parts you don't touch will stay transparent. You can also add images or photos as new layers.  
layer functions: adding text and shapes, copying parts of one image to another, and creating posters or collages. 

# Shapes and vector graphics
The term drawing in image editing apps refers to creating or adding simple forms(triangles,ovals...) to the composition. Shapes can be used to enhance your photos, create Web elements, icons, logos, posters... Shapes are vector-based image elements.

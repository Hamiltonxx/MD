# Layer Mask
A layer mask is like an additional sheet you can place over a layer or layer group to hide parts of it. Layer masks are nondestructive  because even though the parts they hide are no longer shown, the original layer is fully preserved and if you turn off or remove the mask, the full layer will reappear.

# Place a mask over a layer or layer group
- In the Layers sidebar, Add Mask  
- Command-drag any image, shape, text or image from Finder onto a layer to create a mask.

# Edit a layer mask
By default, it is completely white, 100% transparent.  
If you paint over the mask with pure black, the areas you paint over are completely hidden.

# Open an image
The following file formats are supported in Pixelmator Pro: PXD, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, HEIC, PSD, SVG, PDF, GIF, BMP, TGA, WebP.  
When you open an image in one of the above formats, it is automatically converted to PXD. So when you save the image, any additional layers and advanced formatting  you add are not lost and remain editable.  
Alternatively, instead of importing images as PXD documents, you can choose to open them in their original file format -- JPEG,PNG,TIFF,WebP or HEIC.  
Simply dragging images from a website on Safari.

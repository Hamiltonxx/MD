# Introduction
Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin.   
Every 10 minutes, on average, one Bitcoin miner can add security to past transactions and is rewarded with both brand new bitcoins and the fees paid by recent transactions.   
A key innovation was to use a distributed computation system to conduct a global lottery every 10 minutes on average, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice. Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital currency and was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central clearinghouse.  
A Bitcoin wallet is the most common user interface to the Bitcoin system.
